1. Spatial locality refers to the quality of some data structures, such as arrays, to be stored in consecutive memory locations. This allows for faster lookup in RAM.

2. I had some trouble with the Benchmark module, but the main take away is that arrays, which are indexed, have faster lookup times than linked lists, which are not indexed. This is because you must iterate through the entire linked list to find a certain value, and with an array, you can go straight to the given index.
