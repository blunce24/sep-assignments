For all versions, there are two steps in each algorithm:
A. Loading the arrays into a combined array ("Load")
B. Sorting the combined array ("Sort")

1. poorly_written_ruby.rb
The load step has a O(n^2) and the sorting step has a O(n^2) (It uses insertion sort).
The overall complexity is O(n^2)

2. improving_complexity_version_one.rb
The load step has a O(n) and the sorting step has a O(n^2) (It uses insertion sort).
The overall complexity is O(n^2)

3. improving_complexity_version_two.rb
The load step has a O(n) and the soritng step has a O(nlogn) (It uses quicksort).
The overall complexity is O(nlogn)

4. improving_complexity_version_three.rb
The load step has a O(n) and the sorting step has a O(nlogn) (It uses heap sort).
The overall complexity is O(nlogn)
